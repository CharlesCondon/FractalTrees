            <p> 
                A fractal tree is a type of geometric shape that has a 
                self-repeating pattern, where each branch or twig of the 
                tree looks like a smaller version of the whole tree. 
                This pattern repeats itself at different levels of 
                magnification, creating a complex and intricate design.
                They are a visual representation of the mathematical concept 
                of fractals, which are objects or patterns that exhibit 
                self-similarity at different scales. Fractal trees are often 
                used in computer graphics, art, and mathematical modeling, 
                and are known for their beauty and complexity.
