## About:

A fractal tree is a type of geometric shape that has a 
self-repeating pattern, where each branch or twig of the 
tree looks like a smaller version of the whole tree. 
This pattern repeats itself at different levels of 
magnification, creating a complex and intricate design.
They are a visual representation of the mathematical concept 
of fractals, which are objects or patterns that exhibit 
self-similarity at different scales. Fractal trees are often 
used in computer graphics, art, and mathematical modeling, 
and are known for their beauty and complexity.
